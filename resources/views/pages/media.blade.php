                            <p>Islamabad, March 01, 2022: Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health, Dr. Faisal Sultan has inaugurated a Population Resource Center and a Web-Based Reporting Portal for reporting progress on National Action Plan of the Recommendations on Population Management approved by the Council of Common Interests (CCI). Population Programme Wing (PPW), Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations & Coordination in consultation with the Provincial & Regional Governments and other stakeholders has developed a monitoring framework to track progress on the National Action Plan of CCI-Recommendations. The Provinces, Regions and other stakeholders will report their progress on the monitoring framework using the web-portal. The M/o NHSR&C has established the Resource Center as directed by the Federal Task Force on Population headed by the Honorable President of Pakistan in its 4th meeting held on 23rd June, 2021. The CCI approved a set of Recommendations based on eight thematic areas for population management in the country, in its 40th Meeting held on 19th November, 2018. The CCI-Recommendations are focused on achieving targets of population management that are to reduce Population Growth Rate (PGR) to 1.5% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2030, Total Fertility Rate (TFR) to 2.8 in 2025 and 2.2 children per woman in 2030, and increase Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) to 50% in 2025 and 60% in 2030. For the operationalization of the CCI-Recommendations, a National Population Action Plan has been developed to be implemented at Provincial, Regional & Federal Level by the Public & Private stakeholders. For monitoring the progress on the Action Plan, the Web-Based Reporting Portal has been developed for live reporting by all stakeholders. This live reporting will help the population managers and policy makers to use up-to-date data in their plans / strategies for family planning & reproductive health in the country. In addition, the reporting will also help the Federal, Provincial & Regional Governments to identify the weak areas in population programme and make changes in their plans accordingly. In addition, Contraceptive Logistics Management Information System (CLMIS) has also been linked with the Resource Center. CLMIS was developed with the support of USAID. The CLMIS is a critical system to ensure contraceptive commodity security at the last mile. The system has automated family planning supply chain data for public and private sector and enables end to end product visibility. The system empowers the decision makers through powerful analytics to take timely and informed decisions for contraceptive commodity security. Moreover, research material on population, communication strategies and other material regarding the dynamics of population issue of Pakistan has also been made available at the Resource Center. In fact, Population Resource Center will help the Federal, Provincial & Regional Governments and other stakeholders from Public & Private Sector review the progress on the CCI-Recommendations and revisit their strategies to achieve the national targets regarding PGR, TFR and CPR.</p>

                            <p>Pakistan’s alarming population rate poses high socio-economic risks: President
                                <br/><br/>
                                ISLAMABAD, Feb 18 (APP): President Dr. Arif Alvi on Friday said Pakistan’s rapid population growth was resulting in implications on the socio-economic development of the country and called for a broad-based campaign at the national level to raise awareness among the people.
                                <br/><br/>
                                In an interaction with senior journalists here at the Aiwan-e-Sadr, the president highlighted the media’s key role in addressing the issues and challenges related to population and health.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The meeting was held in line with the recommendations of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) for an engagement with media to encourage them to spread the message on population management, as the country faces a population explosion of 285 million by 2030.
                                <br/><br/>
                                President Alvi stressed that media could play an important role in shaping up public opinion and behaviours regarding family planning.
                                <br/><br/>
                                He mentioned that focusing on the population issue in television talk shows and drama serials could also prove effective in conveying the message to the public.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The president also emphasized the need for political will with an active input by parliamentarians to lead a mass movement of advocacy on population management.
                                <br/><br/>
                                He also advised to properly highlight the discussion of the parliamentary caucus on population growth for public consumption.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The President also urged the media to broadcast public service messages besides using their platforms to raise awareness about the alarming population growth rate in the country.
                                <br/><br/>
                                He acknowledged the positive role of Ulema in raising awareness on family planning and mentioned his initiative of the Friday sermons by scholars using the platform of the Presidency’s Mosque to highlight various social issues.
                                <br/><br/>
                                He added that Islam emphasizes that mothers breastfeed their children for two years, which could help achieve adequate birth spacing and overcome the problem of stunting and malnourishment.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Prime Minister’s Special Assistant on Health Dr. Faisal Sultan said unplanned population growth could become an issue of national security, where the future generation grows in absence of proper education and health facilities.
                                <br/><br/>
                                He said the government was sensitizing the masses at all levels involving political leaders, academia, executive, ulema, civil society, and youth.
                                <br/><br/>
                                It was highlighted that there occurred 4 million unwanted pregnancies in Pakistan due to lack of guidance and the unavailability of contraceptives.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination Nausheen Hamid highlighted the role of the parliamentary caucus in giving recommendations regarding policy-making on population management.
                                <br/><br/>
                                During the open discussion session, the president exchanged views with journalists regarding mass awareness through media platforms.</p>
